# Sales Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview

In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of electronic product sales across various sectors. The analysis covered monthly sales trends, with a focus on different cities, products, and categories. I examined how sales varied city-wise, product-wise, and category-wise for each month, identifying the highest and lowest sales periods. This helped in understanding sales patterns and provided valuable insights into sector-wise performance across different timeframes.

## Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables
Data Cleaning Techniques
Formulas for Data Calculation
Charts for Data Visualization

## Workflow
1. Data Import
The dataset was stored in a CSV file named "Sales Data.csv".
The data includes sales information for various products, categories, and sales reps across different cities.
2. Data Cleaning
- After importing the CSV file into Excel, I performed some basic data cleaning to ensure accuracy:
    -- Checked for any missing values or incorrect entries.
    -- Standardized the format of dates and text fields to maintain consistency
