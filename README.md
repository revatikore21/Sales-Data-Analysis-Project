# Sales Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview

In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of electronic product sales across various sectors. The analysis covered monthly sales trends, with a focus on different cities, products, and categories. I examined how sales varied city-wise, product-wise, and category-wise for each month, identifying the highest and lowest sales periods. This helped in understanding sales patterns and provided valuable insights into sector-wise performance across different timeframes.

## Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Cleaning Techniques
- Formulas for Data Calculation
- Charts for Data Visualization

## Workflow
1. Data Import
- The dataset was stored in a CSV file named "Sales Data.csv".
The data includes sales information for various products, categories, and sales reps across different cities.
2. Data Cleaning
- After importing the CSV file into Excel, I performed some basic data cleaning to ensure accuracy:
    i)Checked for any missing values or incorrect entries.
    ii)Standardized the format of dates and text fields to maintain consistency
3. Adding New Columns
4. Pivot Table Creation
5. Data Analysis and Visualization
6. Slicers for Dynamic Filtering
  - The slicer allows users to filter the visualizations based on the selected month.
  - All charts in the dashboard are connected to the slicer, which updates the data displayed dynamically when a specific month is selected.
The final output is an interactive Dashboard.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my skills in data importing, cleaning, pivot table creation, and data visualization using Excel. By leveraging these tools, I was able to build a comprehensive sales dashboard that provides meaningful insights into sales performance across different dimensions.
